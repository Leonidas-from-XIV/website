- "I used to play the trumpet, for almost a decade. I was member of an orchestra and, for a shorter time (only about three years), of a small ensemble."
- "I went to a boarding school starting at age 14. It was a public school with strong focus on STEM."
- "Between school and university I was on vacation to Canada. We visited Vancouver, and later, Yukon (of all places!)."
- "I'm one of the most organised people you'll ever meet, even by German standards."
- "I don't travel nearly as much as some of you, yet I've been keeping a spreadsheet tracking every single day away from home since when I turned 16."
- "I like trains. Unless a train ride would take longer than 8 hours, I will not fly to a destination. Long-distance buses if no other option is available."
- "I became a vegetarian around my 22nd birthday. I've since become a bit more flexible (let's say 80% veg these days). I won't start a discussion about eating meat unless quizzed about it."
- "I don't drink. I didn't drink, ever. I'm not planning on starting to drink anytime soon. (Alcohol, obviously. Trace amounts in foods are fine though.) This has neither religious nor health reasons. This confuses people."
- "I have a driver's license, but I hate driving with a passion. I'll readily admit that I'm a below-average-skilled driver, which is why I should probably be not on the road, unless absolutely necessary."
- "I gave my first public talk in English at the Northeast Scala Symposium in 2013. I was scared shitless about this. More than five years later, I'm at the point where I have to practice more for talks in German, for my lack of technical words."
- "If I haven't miscounted, I've been to 36 conferences in my life so far (from 2007, in which my first attendance happened, until March 2018; I may update this number in the future)."
- "The only sports I actually enjoy are cycling and bouldering, but I'm not overly ambitious in either."
- "I read (almost) the entire book \"The C++ Programming Language\" when I was fifteen years old."
- "I'm a diehard fan of the German Sunday evening crime show (Tatort or Polizeiruf 110)."
- "I learned to program in 2003 with Python. I used to be super confused about the indentation syntax."
- "I hate losing data. I've upgraded my parents' internet connection to allow for bidirectional off-site backups. Important stuff additionally goes on archival-grade optical disks."
- "The population difference between where I live now and where I grew up is five orders of magnitude (1.4 M vs ~130)."
- "I am unable to grow a reasonable beard. After a week of not shaving I just look very silly."
- "My shortest flight ever: just above 50 km (Cumaná ✈️ Margarita)."
- "I was at an Irish concert once (both the songs and the announcements were in Irish). I didn't understand a word, but it was amazing."
- "I have an unreasonable obsession over election systems and government structures. Ask me about state legislature redistricting and its effects on term lengths in the US."
- "The only thing that makes me \"real\" East German is my birth certificate. Reunification happened a few weeks after birth."
- "Touch-typing (with QWERTZ layout) is deeply ingrained into my brain, because I learned it in 2001 already. Sometimes I get mildly annoyed watching people non-touch type."
- "Even if I don't know anyone in the audience, it's much easier for me to give a talk than to walk up to someone specific and chat them up at a conference."

- "I'm a terrible punster. You will groan about my puns."
- "I got made fun of at a San Francisco comedy club once."
- "I got made fun of because I was late one single time. I'm always early (usually). Unless I'm on time, in which case I feel like I'm late."
- "In a small team I work best as a \"facilitator\" of sorts, e.g. getting people up to speed, managing tasks, keeping tabs on everything."
- "I like to think that I'm quite good at finding the cause of bugs, even of codebases I don't know well, partly because I'm so stubborn."
- "I'm more of a dog person because I'm allergic to cats (and many other animals, including horses and rabbits). I'm slightly allergic to dogs too, but they don't evoke such a strong reaction as cats."
- "I like pubs in Ireland (both ROI and NI). Those are some of the least judgemental social spaces I've ever been to. No alcohol? No problem."
