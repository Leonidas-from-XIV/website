abstract="Many theorem provers can generate functional programs from definitions or proofs. However, this code generation needs to be trusted. Except for the HOL4 system, which has a proof producing code generator for a subset of ML. We go one step further and provide a verified compiler from Isabelle/HOL to CakeML. More precisely we combine a simple proof producing translation of recursion equations in Isabelle/HOL into a deeply embedded term language with a fully verified compilation chainÂ to the target language CakeML.",
