**Fun facts about me:**

1. I used to play the trumpet, for almost a decade. I was member of an orchestra and, for a shorter time (only about three years), of a small ensemble.
2. I went to a boarding school starting at age 14. It was a public school with strong focus on STEM.
3. Between school and university I was on vacation to Canada. We visited Vancouver, and later, Yukon (of all places!).
4. Before I joined Twitter in 2012, I would have described myself as a conservative. (I voted CDU in our school's mock elections 😱) That changed dramatically after hanging out on Twitter.
5. I'm one of the most organised people you'll ever meet, even by German standards.
6. I don't travel nearly as much as some of you, yet I've been keeping a spreadsheet tracking every single day away from home since when I turned 16.
7. I like trains. Unless a train ride would take longer than 8 hours, I will not fly to a destination. Long-distance buses if no other option is available.
8. I became a vegetarian around my 22nd birthday. I've since become a bit more flexible (let's say 80% veg these days). I won't start a discussion about eating meat unless quizzed about it.
9. I don't drink. I didn't drink, ever. I'm not planning on starting to drink anytime soon. (Alcohol, obviously. Trace amounts in foods are fine though.) This has neither religious nor health reasons. This confuses people.
10. I have a driver's license, but I hate driving with a passion. I'll readily admit that I'm a below-average-skilled driver, which is why I should probably be not on the road, unless absolutely necessary.
11. I gave my first public talk in English at the Northeast Scala Symposium in 2013. I was scared shitless about this. More than five years later, I'm at the point where I have to practice more for talks in German, for my lack of technical words.
12. If I haven't miscounted, I've been to 36 conferences in my life so far (from 2007, in which my first attendance happened, until March 2018; I may update this number in the future).
13. The only sports I actually enjoy are cycling and bouldering too, but I'm not overly ambitious in either.
14. I read (almost) the entire book "The C++ Programming Language" when I was fifteen years old.
15. I'm a diehard fan of the German Sunday evening crime show (Tatort or Polizeiruf 110).
16. I learned to program in 2003 with Python. I used to be super confused about the indentation syntax.
17. I hate losing data. I've upgraded my parents' internet connection to allow for bidirectional off-site backups. Important stuff additionally goes on archival-grade optical disks.
18. The population difference between where I live now and where I grew up is five orders of magnitude (1.4 M vs ~130).
19. I am unable to grow a reasonable beard. After a week of not shaving I just look very silly.
20. My shortest flight ever: just above 50 km (Cumaná ✈️ Margarita).
21. I was at an Irish concert once (both the songs and the announcements were in Irish). I didn't understand a word, but it was amazing.
22. I have an unreasonable obsession over election systems and government structures. Ask me about state legislature redistricting and its effects on term lengths in the US.
23. The only thing that makes me "real" East German is my birth certificate. Reunification happened a few weeks after birth.
24. Touch-typing (with QWERTZ layout) is deeply ingrained into my brain, because I learned it in 2001 already. Sometimes I get mildly annoyed watching people non-touch type.
25. Even if I don't know anyone in the audience, it's much easier for me to give a talk than to walk up to someone specific and chat them up at a conference.
26. Countries I've visited, in no particular order: 🇦🇹 🇨🇭 🇫🇷 🇮🇹 🇨🇿 🇵🇱 🇧🇬 🇹🇷 🇱🇮 🇬🇧 🇮🇪 🇳🇱 🇬🇷 🇪🇸 🇵🇹 🇺🇲 🇲🇽 🇨🇦 🇻🇪 🇮🇩 🇩🇰 🇸🇪 🇳🇴
27. I'm a terrible punster. You will groan about my puns.
28. I got made fun of at a San Francisco comedy club once.
29. I got made fun of because I was late one single time. I'm always early (usually). Unless I'm on time, in which case I feel like I'm late.
30. In a small team I work best as a "facilitator" of sorts, e.g. getting people up to speed, managing tasks, keeping tabs on everything.
31. I like to think that I'm quite good at finding the cause of bugs, even of codebases I don't know well, partly because I'm so stubborn.
32. I'm more of a dog person because I'm allergic to cats (and many other animals, including horses and rabbits). I'm slightly allergic to dogs too, but they don't evoke such a strong reaction as cats.
33. I like pubs in Ireland (both ROI and NI). Those are some of the least judgemental social spaces I've ever been to. No alcohol? No problem.

**Contributed facts:**

1. It is incredibly easy to break Lars for a while by making precisely the right kind of bad joke. He will break out in hilariously over-the-top laughter for several minutes, often followed by ‘Just a second, I have to tweet this.’ (Manuel)
2. Lars has a thing for Monsteras. He owns a number of them and they have grown to absurd dimensions. The one in his flat almost consumed his wardrobe with an impenetrable growth of tendrils. (Manuel)
3. Lars is a great teacher and managed to fill me with enthusiasm for theoretical computer science. (Bene)
